Save the Children believes that every child deserves the best chance for a bright future and that’s why we are fiercely committed towards ensuring that children not only survive, but thrive. We run programmes in the remotest corners of India and urban areas to provide quality education and healthcare, protection from harm and abuse and life-saving aid during emergencies to children. Globally, Save the Children is present in more than 80 countries and works to improve the lives of the most vulnerable children living there.<br><br>

Every child deserves the best chance for a bright future. And that’s why we are fiercely committed to ensuring children not only survive, but thrive. Bold in our ambition and powerful in our care, we do whatever it takes to save the world’s children.<br><br>
 
In India and around the world, Save the Children is on the ground – every day and in times of crisis. Our pioneering programmes address children’s unique needs, giving them a healthy start, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm. When crisis strikes, we are always among the first to respond and the last to leave. We are outspoken champions for children, ensuring their voices are heard and their issues are given top priority. Drawing on a century of leading expertise, we take on the toughest challenges facing the hardest-to-reach children – especially those unfairly excluded from the world’s progress.<br><br>
 
We are proud to be the world’s leading expert on children, delivering lasting results for millions of vulnerable girls and boys. By saving the world’s children, we transform their lives and the future we share.<br><br>
